          Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP), the Ordinance to the Federal
          Act on Data Protection (DPO) and other data protection provisions

          such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
        </p>

        <p><strong>1. Collection and Use of Personal Data</strong></p>

        </p>

        <p><strong>8. Tracking tools</strong></p>
        <p>
          We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google
          Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin,
          D04 E5W5, Ireland or Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain
          View, CA 94043-1351, USA. Google Analytics uses methods that enable an
          analysis of the use of the website, such as cookies. These generate
          information about your use of this website, such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Navigation path a visitor takes on the website</li>
          <li>Length of time spent on the website or sub-page</li>
          <li>The sub-page on which the website is left</li>
          <li>The country, region or city from which access is gained</li>
          <li>
            Device (type, version, colour depth, resolution, width and height of
            the browser window)
          </li>
          <li>Returning or new visitors</li>
          <li>Browser type/version</li>
          <li>The operating system used</li>
          <li>The referrer URL (the previously visited page)</li>
          <li>Host name of the accessing computer (IP address)</li>
          <li>Time of the server request</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This data is transferred to and stored on Google servers located in
          the U.S. By activating IP anonymisation («anonymiseIP») on this
          website, your IP address is shortened before transmission within the
          member states of the European Union or other states party to the
          Agreement on the European Economic Area and Switzerland.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to Google, the anonymised IP address transmitted by the
          user’s browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with
          other Google data. Only in exceptional cases can the full IP address
          be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. In
          these cases, we ensure through contractual guarantees that Google
          maintains a sufficient level of data protection. The information will
          be used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on
          website activity and to provide other services relating to website and
          internet usage for the purposes of market research and website
          customisation. Google may also transfer this information to third
          parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties
          process the information on Google’s behalf. According to Google, a
          connection between the IP address and other user data will not be
          established under any circumstances.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within the scope of application of the GDPR, this processing is
          carried out for our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6
          (1) lit. f GDPR. You can object to this data processing at any time by
          notifying us. You can also prevent the data collection described above
          by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the
          following link: <a

          cookies, the link must be clicked again.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use Google Maps API (Application Programming Interface, «Google
          Maps») from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street,
          Dublin 4, Ireland, or Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain
          View, CA 94043-1351, USA, on our website for the visual display of
          geographical information (maps). By using Google Maps, information
          about the use of our website, including your IP address, is
          transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the scope of application of the GDPR, the legal basis for
          processing data for this purpose is our legitimate interest pursuant
          to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. You can object to this data processing at
          any time by notifying us.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible to deactivate Google Maps and prevent data transfers to
          Google by deactivating JavaScript in your browser. This will result in
          you not being able to use the map display.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more information on the collection, processing and use of your
          data by Google and your rights in this regard, please refer to the

          On our website, we may also include links to our social media profiles
          on the social networks:

          If you click on the corresponding icons of the social networks, you
          will automatically be redirected to our profile in the corresponding
          social network. In order to be able to use the functions of the
          respective network there, you must partially log into your user
          account for the respective network. When you open a link to one of our
          social media profiles, a direct connection is established between your
          browser and the server of the social network in question. This
          provides the network with the information that you have visited our
          website with your IP address and accessed the link. If you access a
          link to a network while logged into your account with the network in
          question, the content of our site may be linked to your profile on the
          network, which means that the network can link your visit to our
          website directly to your user account. If you want to prevent this,
          you should log out before clicking on the relevant links. In any case,
          an allocation takes place when you log into the corresponding network
          after clicking on the link.
